# Automation vs Documentation Which Takes More Time

As I was reading Jose's article which I enjoted it occurred to me that it would have taken a lot longer to author the article as an alternative to Authoring the PowerShell Script to just do it all.

## DOCUMENTATION Steps

1. Start Taking Screen Capture,Crop and Save
2. Write Text that Belongs to that Screen Capture, Proofread etc.
3. Repeat 1 and 2 about 30 more times.
4. Ideally get someone else to review as may have made a mistake or a step could be unclear
5. Publish the page and troubleshoot/tweak in your CMS

## Code Steps

1. Master PowerShell and Excel COM (admittedly this may take a while)
2. Write Code (In VS Code so a nice linter and debug environment.)
3. Test Code Iteratively.
4. Add Some Documentation to code.

You should perform the same exercise with an internal task considering the script will work many times over and the Documented
process will still need to be performed manually and interactively every time affording the chance for human error.
