# 29 ways to triumph as an independent developer

> Above all, understand and accept that “going independent” means “starting a business,” and a business is very different from a job.

## 1 Know why you’re doing this

Before you write that letter of resignation,
think about why you want to become an
independent software developer. Do you want
to work from home? Do you want to travel? Do
you want more money, fewer hours, or both?
What are your main motivations for making this
change? Write them down somewhere because
chances are all of your goals will not be met
immediately. When things get tough, that list
will remind you of why you are doing this, and
that can make the difference between giving up
and success.

## 2 Plan before you quit

Going independent can give you
greater say in the kind of work you do.
And in the world of software, there are many
possibilities; you don’t have to do exactly what
you do at your current job. Consulting, development,
products, training, and other services are
all viable paths to independence. Make a list of
everything you can do, everything you’d like to
do, and everything you might be interested in
learning how to do. Having that list will help
prepare you to recognize opportunities when
they arise.
Similarly, make a list of all the ways you can
find and attract clients. When you make the
leap, you’ll want to be in a position where you
have more offers than you can accept.

## 3 Securing your first contract is key

The first contract can be the hardest, or
the easiest. It is not uncommon for someone to
resign as an employee then turn right around and
contract with their former employer, doing exactly
the same job as before, just with a different
financial arrangement -- but it is not guaranteed.
Another option is to contact a recruiting firm and
have them find you a position that you like -- and
make the terms of engagement corp-to-corp.
This is how I started: I lost my “secure” job, and
frankly, it was the best thing that ever happened
to me. I called a friendly recruiter when I got
home and had my first independent gig two days
later -- at almost twice the pay.

## 4 Diversify your business skill set

Your job responsibilities will include
everything, not just coding. Going it alone
means going it alone. You’ll have to do all of the
work that your current team and organization
do for you. This applies to both technical skills
and “soft” skills -- either you learn how to do it
yourself, or you hire someone to do it for you. If
you hire others to help you, you’ll have to learn
how to manage people at the very least, but
ideally how to lead them. Communication skills
may mean more to your bottom line than sheer
coding talent.

## 5 Deliver exceptional service and quality

This may seem like an obvious platitude,
but consider that the average office worker
is productive only three to six hours per day,
according to recent surveys. The rest of the time
is sucked away in meetings, emails, social media,
and various other nonproductive distractions.
When you are the business, you can eat
Twinkies, drink Mountain Dew, and surf the
Web all day if you want to. But chances are you
only get paid when things get done -- so getting
things done consistently, efficiently, and well
will become paramount to the survival of your
business. This makes Reddit a lot less interesting
than a paycheck. Happy clients are key,
and consistently delivering extraordinary results
makes them happy.

## 6 Sweat the small stuff

Many tasks don’t pay directly, but can
lead to business failure (not to mention
legal/tax trouble) if omitted. Accounting, cash
flow, collections, contracts, liability insurance, and
so on are easy to forget or postpone -- don’t!
Other small things may suddenly matter, like
being awake during business hours, answering
your phone promptly, and having suitable clothes
to wear to meetings with prospects and clients.
The hip slacker image that works so well in your
laid-back office job may not fly when you and
only you represent the entire business. People
will perceive you according to their inherent
expectations, and you cannot control or change
that -- but you can be aware of it, and prepare
accordingly.

## 7 Always be marketing

Focusing only on the paying work in
front of you and letting everything
else slide is a good way to code yourself out of
a job. Pay attention to additional opportunities
with current clients, ask for referrals, continually
prospect, and keep your pipeline full.
Marketing and sales are not evil; they are
necessary. Even if all you have is a résumé on a
job site, that is still marketing -- and the product
is you. Even the best of clients can have sudden
downturns; you do not want to be at the mercy
of one client. To paraphrase Naomi Dunford of
ittybiz.com, “If the vast majority of your income
depends on one client, you don’t have a business,
you have a job.”

## 8 Get organized

Since you are responsible for everything,
you must be organized. I recommend
David Allen’s Getting Things Done system,
but any system used consistently will do.
Whatever you choose, get things out of
your head and into the system, and review it
consistently. It is far too easy to think that you
can remember everything you need to be doing,
and perhaps you can, for a while, but the effort
is draining and wasteful. An organizational
system is not supposed to be a straightjacket or
a dictator; it is a tool. Apply your organizational
system consistently to all of your areas of responsibility
-- not just technical ones -- to ensure that
you are always on top of everything that needs
to be done.

Focusing only
on the paying
work in front of
you and letting
everything else
slide is a good
way to code
yourself out of
a job.

## 9 Going independent is not a promotion

There is a huge difference between
going independent and getting
promoted to management. If you
get promoted to management,
you become responsible primarily
for the work of others, along with
a load of administrative issues
that you may not enjoy. If you go
independent, you get managerial
responsibilities and keep all your
technical responsibilities as well.
Many good programmers
have been ruined when turned into managers;
many excellent technical people are simply not
happy in management roles. If this is you, that
is fine, just be aware of it and plan accordingly
-- perhaps by hiring an assistant or designating
one day a week as “admin day.” As an independent
developer, you are both management and
worker, and you must do both well to succeed.

## 10 Get out of your own way

Don’t be your own barrier to business
growth. At some point you will hit a limit of
how much work you can do personally and still
keep up with the business, maintain your health
and family/social ties, and generally keep from
burning out. You can raise your rates, but only
up to a point. Learn how to delegate, sooner
rather than later.
Many businesses that are otherwise doing
well reach a tipping point where they fail
because the person in charge cannot delegate,
and that bottleneck strangles the business. If
things are falling behind because everyone is
waiting on you to do something, take this as a
warning sign.

## 11 Know when to scale back, and when to double down

When you hit your limit, you can contract or
expand. To do less, consider firing “bad” clients,
raising your rates, and making better use of your
time. To expand, consider hiring help, delegating
or eliminating tasks, and diversifying your products
and services.

In “The 4-Hour Work Week,” Tim Ferriss
recommends several tactics to reduce the work
you must do to a bare minimum, while maintaining
the same income level. Some of these
tactics will work for software developers, such
as outsourcing administrative tasks to trusted
assistants (virtual or otherwise), while other
tactics are appropriate only for product-based
businesses. The point is not to blindly follow
anyone’s advice -- especially strangers on the
Internet -- but to know what your options are
and choose wisely.

## 12 Consider the product

Products have a distinct advantage
over services: Products scale.
You can only sell an hour of your time once, and
it’s gone, but you can sell a product over and
over, even while you sleep.
Of course, products have their own overhead:
First you have to write it, then you have to
sell it. But once it is selling well, the only drain on
your time is support, and counting your money.
Consider building products (that people actually
want) while supporting yourself by selling
your services. If you can transform some of your
services into products, so much the better.

## 13 Brand and network

People need to know about you.
Whether you call it promotion or
marketing or branding, the requirement is the
same: Get the word out, with a consistent image
and message about the kind of services and
quality you provide. You can start a blog, join the
local Chamber of Commerce, answer questions
in LinkedIn groups, post instructive videos to
YouTube, and so on.
Choose a few ways that you are comfortable
with, and start. Be creative, use your imagination,
find ways to stand out that represent you
well, but above all make sure the channels you
choose are populated with likely prospects. Try
several approaches, track where your leads come
from, and then concentrate on the avenues that
prove fruitful.

## 14 Replace yourself

Eventually you may decide that
you’ve had enough of being
responsible for every aspect of your business;
that’s the time to replace yourself. You can
replace yourself with one person, if it’s the right
person. More likely, your responsibilities will
be divided among multiple people. This can be
good, especially if the people you find share your
philosophy and work ethic and are better at their
jobs than you are.
Finding the right people can take a lot of
effort, and you may have to go through a few
to find the right one. It’s best to test and fire
early rather than invest too much time in trying
to train or educate someone who is not up to
your standards.

## 15 Take care of your primary asset

The primary asset of your business
is you. If you become burned out, or ill, or your
skills get out of date, your business will suffer.
There are no sick days, there are rarely vacations,
and deadlines don’t care how you feel.
Be aware of new developments in your field,
but spend R&D time wisely -- not only on things
your clients want, but also on things that excite
you.
Occasionally turn off the computer and go
outside. Socialize with friends, spend quality time
with family and loved ones, read a nontechnical
book, and enjoy being human.
Most importantly, when the going gets
rough, take time to recharge and remember why
you started this journey. The payoff of time off to
refocus is tremendous.

## 16 Don’t code yourself out of business

High-quality code is vital to
independent developer success, but heads-down
coding is a job, not a business.
To be certain, you should always be thorough,
with an eye toward delivering the best
code you can. But make sure you have something
else in the pipeline to work on when
you’re done.
When coding, it’s all too easy to focus only

on the work in front of you. In fact, it’s far
more efficient to devote yourself to coding
than it is to task-switch between development,
marketing, sales, planning, administration, and
so on. But that’s exactly what you will have to
do to succeed. Billable work pays the bills, but
finding more work keeps your business afloat.

## 17 Never forget that you are your brand

You may not realize it starting
out, but even if you are working solo as
an outside contractor with only one client,
you have a brand, and that brand is you.
Remember: A brand is a promise of quality
and consistency, and though it can stand for
whatever you think is important as a developer,
it must be precise.
How you present yourself, your work, your
team, and your development philosophy is
the bedrock of your brand, and it should be
reflected in all facets of your business, from
your website to your business card to how you
discuss your work with a casual acquaintance
on a day off. If you are vague or inconsistent,
your business will suffer.
Too often, independent software developers
define their business by a tool or fad. Brands
built around tools quickly become commodities
-- would you rather hire a “Java shop” or
an “expert in enterprise applications systems
development”? Brands built around the latest
trends can be lucrative, temporarily, but they
too quickly become commodities.
The more specific you can be about your
work and what you stand for, the easier it is to
distinguish yourself from others, and the easier
it is to identify and locate potential clients.
More important, establishing a clear brand
makes it easier for potential clients to identify
and locate you.

## 18 Remember that you can’t be everything to everybody

Customer satisfaction is essential to your
success as an independent developer, but trying
to please everybody can sink your business
quickly. It causes you to spread your resources
too thin, in the end pleasing no one.
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go the
extra mile to serve clients to the best of your
ability, or never take on work outside of your
comfort zone. But pay attention to the limits of
your abilities and resources. Overcommitting or
signing up for work you can’t complete to the
level your customers expect can quickly poison
your business.
Instead, be diligent about logging your
work, so you can be accurate in estimating
your bandwidth when special requests arise.
Increment your experimentation into new
areas rather than promise to deliver big, merely
because you know you can learn new tools
quickly. Remember -- you have a business to
run, and mastering tech to the level of your
brand takes time away from paying work.

## 19 Be wary of targeting the wrong market

Small businesses struggling to
grow out of manual systems may seem like
the ideal client for your fledgling independent
software business; after all, they stand to reap
the greatest benefits from automation. But they
can also be the least trusting of technology
and outsiders, and their cash flow may not be
consistent enough to afford your services.
Targeting the “right” market is more art
than science, but one vastly oversimplified
maxim is to seek a combination of fit, finance,
and fearlessness. Finding the best fit for your
services is a complex, volatile process of ambitions,
problems, needs, skills, gaps, benefits,
and timing. There is likely to be no external
signals for these, so you have to talk to a lot
of people in various industries and organizations
to find out. As you are doing this, you
can assess the financial issue -- if an industry
or organization can’t afford your services, the
whole process is pointless.
Gauging “fearlessness” is more of a gut
instinct. Do the players in your targeted market
have the organizational courage to see your
partnership through? Software systems change

Think of it
this way:

is a job;
multiple

streams,

business operations; for many industries, and
many organizations, change is scary. Don’t get
lost chasing timid leads.

## 20 Develop the ability to identify any project’s “champion”

Every software project has a “champion” (or
“patron” if you prefer). This is the person with
the authority to write the checks to pay for
your work and the will to defend your project
internally to ensure it succeeds. It is essential to
identify this person and cultivate a meaningful
relationship, where possible.
All too often the champion is not present,
revealed, or even mentioned in consultative
meetings. Worse, department heads or senior
executives often insist they have the authority
and budget to get the project done, when in fact
that is not the case.
Always look at who signs the checks. In some
companies, department managers have discretionary
budgets and are indeed the champion
of their projects. In other companies, executives
higher up the chain -- sometimes more than one
-- are the true, hidden champions; their approval
is required for project expenditures.
It’s not unusual, especially in smaller, privately
held businesses, for the company president to be
presented as the project champion, but in reality
the CFO or company owner has to sign the
checks. Don’t be fooled into thinking you have a
stronger commitment than you actually have.

## 21 Establish (and maintain) a sales pipeline

Selling custom software development
is a slow, consultative process. Prospects
may know they have a problem, but they may
not be sure they really want to solve it. After
all, the decision to adopt a custom solution can
change the direction and foundation of an entire
business; the bigger the business, the longer
it takes to decide and turn. Even highly qualified,
eager referrals from happy clients can take
several months to close.

This means you must always add prospects
to your sales pipeline. You must also always
measure time spent and results. These numbers
are crucial to keeping your pipeline flowing.
Suppose you need one client to support
your business for half a year, and you can close
one sale in six months for every 600 prospects
you encounter. In this simplistic example, fewer
than 100 prospects entering your pipeline every
month could mean trouble.
In reality, the numbers are more complicated,
but the structure of the pipeline remains
the same: prospects in, time elapsed, sales out.
Always be tracking time to qualify, time to close,
average deal size, and close percentages. Use
these numbers to project future income from the
current pipeline. Subtract future costs and allow
for projects (and income) ending. This will give
you a leading indicator: If the resulting number is
negative or trending downward, you are at risk
of insufficient cash flow unless you add more
clients to the pipeline.

## 22 Diversify your client base

Most independent software
developers get their start with one main client.
This can be a great way to strike out on your
own, but beware attempting to maintain a business
this way. When that one client has a hiccup,
you’ll be scrambling -- or out of business.
The other downside of having one main
client is that they may start thinking of you
as “staff augmentation” instead of “valued
business partner,” with demands going up
and respect going down simultaneously. Three
medium clients are better than one large one.
Twenty small clients may be better still, as it
is highly unlikely that a majority of them will
suddenly stop at once.
Think of it this way: One client is a job;
multiple clients, with diverse revenue streams,
comprise a business.

## 23 Always account for taxes and overhead

Most ISVs are LLCs or S-Corps,
both of which are “pass-through” companies
in the United States. This means you have to
account for and pay estimated taxes as you
go, and usually even more at the end of the
year; nothing is deducted for you. Even if you
pay yourself a salary, your finances can still get
complicated and surprising at the end of the
year. A good CPA can help, but it takes consistent
financial discipline to stay current.
Nothing can sink your business like inattention
to taxes.

## 24 Do not play fast and loose with collections and cash overflow

Most independent development shops run
“lean,” as in “very little cash buffer to fall back
on.” This can turn a minor payment issue into a
layoff-inducing company crisis.
The fact is, clients don’t always pay on time;
this is normal, and it helps the relationship to
be flexible. But if you notice a pattern -- unexplained
delays, administrative misplacement of
invoices, waiting on someone to sign checks,
and so on -- the client may be having internal
problems they aren’t telling you about.
This may be a temporary issue, but it could
last long enough to put you under water if you’re
not prepared for the possibility. Do your best to
keep a buffer and pay close attention to collections.
Understand the client’s payment process,
who is involved, and how long it takes; investigate
immediately if the pattern starts to quaver.

## 25 Hire people only once you’re sure you have enough paying work for them

A chief concern when going independent is
knowing when it’s time to no longer go it alone.
While staying lean at the expense of adding help
is the norm for some, it’s nearly as easy to overestimate
the scope or certainty of new projects and
bring on eager, even inexpensive talent to help.
After all, the only way to grow is to grow, right?
But this can increase your overhead significantly
without increasing your revenue -- in
terms of both budget and time. Changing
processes to accommodate new head count,
training new hires, managing workloads -- it
can quickly derail your ability to close sales and
deliver the quality your customers have come to
expect. Hire cautiously.

## 26 Go talk to prospects - you really do have to learn the sales aspect of the business

Most developers who go independent do it to
solve problems, write code, and deliver results.
They may not enjoy marketing and sales activities,
but these activities can’t be ignored -- and
I do not recommend that you outsource them
completely, at least not initially.
There are no shortcuts to sales that work
reliably, and each technique and tool alters
your process in ways both subtle and gross.
Long shots happen, but don’t bet the farm on
them; instead focus on steady, reliable, refinable
systems that you thoroughly understand.
Evaluate each marketing/sales tactic and
tool with the same critical eye you would use
when deciding to adopt a new programming
language or IDE. Play with it, run some tests and
benchmarks, consider how it impacts everything
else you’re doing, and resist the urge to change
directions too frequently. Even the most reliable,

time-tested, surefire sales techniques take time
and tweaking to work, so set realistic expectations
and timelines, and be wary of abandoning
existing systems before you understand them.
If you hopped on the latest programming trend
every month, you’d never finish anything and
would quickly go out of business. The same
applies to marketing/sales tools and trends.
Like it or not, there is no escaping the basic
marketing/sales education process, learning curve,
and effort. Go talk to prospects. There’s no other
way to learn this aspect of your business.

## 27 Document, refine and automate processes and systems

Processes and documentation may seem like the
stuff of slow, dinosaur companies -- they may
even be the chief reasons you left your corporate
job -- but the truth is, an efficient independent
software business depends on them.
Chances are you already have processes you
have followed, repeated, and refined for years.
Some you may have even taught, directly or
indirectly, to others. Do yourself a favor: Write
them down, discuss and refine them often, and
automate wherever possible.
Automation is your bread and butter. You
probably extol the virtues of automation to
your clients all day long. But your own internal
systems are manual or nonexistent. This makes
results somewhat unpredictable; worse, it wastes
your time -- and for an entrepreneur, time is the
most critical nonrenewable resource.
Manual or hacked-together systems are fine
to start with, but don’t stay satisfied with them.
Removing tedious, repetitive work reduces friction
across all processes.
Look first at where most of your nonproductive
time goes, and automate that. “Automation”
in this sense includes all options, from fully
automatic software systems that do everything
for you while you sleep, to virtual assistants to
personal assistants to outsourcing specialists and
any combination of the above.

## 28 Pay attention to how you’re going to provide customer support

Poor support is a major reason why clients
change service providers. The less support
needed, the better, but being known for excellent
support is pure gold -- not just because it
maintains customer relationships after sales and
delivery, but because outstanding support turns
your customers into evangelists.
This doesn’t only mean fixing problems in
the middle of the night. It means helping clients
understand every facet of your solution, teaching
them how to perform tasks and fixes themselves,
and providing all of the information they need to
remain confident they made the right choice for
their business’ future.
Because that’s what you build for your
clients: their future. You may not have to live in it
for long, but they do. Support their decision and
vision, and reinforce and reassure them. There is
no such thing as “not my problem.”

## 29 Learn how to delegate effectively

When you go it alone, every
decision is important, and because it’s your
business, you’re on the hook to make every
one of them. As your company grows, the
decisions mount -- which projects to pursue,
how to juggle workloads, where to investigate
new leads -- and they can quickly dam up and
destroy the company.
With clear guidelines, responsibilities, and
processes, delegation can be your most valuable
tool, and one that can be comfortable even for
the most control-freakish of development shop
owners.
