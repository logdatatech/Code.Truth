## ONE

> Finding and fixing a software problem after delivery is often 100 times more expensive than finding and fixing it during the requirements and design phase.

NOTE: the cost-escalation factor for small, non critical software systems to be more like 5:1 than 100:1.

---

## TWO

> Current software projects spend about 40 to 50 percent of their effort on avoidable rework.

Such rework consists of effort spent fixing software difficulties that could have been discovered earlier and fixed
less expensively or avoided altogether.

---

## THREE

> About 80 percent of avoidable rework comes from 20 percent of the defects.

That 80 percent value may be lower for smaller systems and higher for very large ones.

---

## FOUR

> About 80 percent of the defects come from 20 percent of the modules, and about half the modules are defect free.

Between 60 and 90 percent of the defects arise from 20 percent of the modules, with a median of about 80 percent.

With equal consistency, nearly all defects cluster in about half the modules produced.

## FIVE

> About 90 percent of the downtime comes from, at most, 10 percent of the defects.

Some defects disproportionately affect downtime and reliability.

For example, analysis of failure of nine large IBM software products revealed that 0.3 percent
of the defects accounted for about 90 percent of the downtime.

## SIX

> Peer reviews catch 60 percent of the defects.

Peer review provides an effective technique that catches from 31 to 93 percent of the defects, with a median of around 60 percent.

---

# SEVEN

> Perspective-based reviews catch 35 percent more defects than non-directed reviews.

Scenario-based reading techniques have been applied in requirements, object-oriented design, and user interface inspections.

Improvements in fault detection rates vary from 15 to 50 percent.

---

## EIGHT

> Disciplined personal practices can reduce defect introduction rates by up to 75 percent.

Best practices are not to punish once the learning curve has been reached they really pay off.

---

## NINE

> All other things being equal, it costs 50 percent more per source instruction to develop high-dependability software products than to develop low-dependability software products.

However, the investment is more than worth it if the  project involves significant operations and maintenance costs.

## TEN

> About 40 to 50 percent of user programs contain non-trivial defects.

A 1987 Study found 44 percent of spreadsheet programs produced by experienced spreadsheet developers contained non-trivial defects.

Yet the developers felt confident that they had produced accurate spreadsheets.

Subsequent laboratory experiments defective spreadsheet rates between 35 and 90 percent.

Now, and increasingly in the future, user programs will escalate from spreadsheets
to internet facing Web-scripting languages.

The ranks of **“sorcerer’s apprentice” user-programmers** will also swell rapidly, giving many who have little training or expertise in how to
avoid or detect high-risk defects tremendous power to create high-risk defects.
