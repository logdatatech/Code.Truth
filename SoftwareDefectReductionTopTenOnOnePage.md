## ONE - Finding and fixing problems after delivery is 100 times more expensive during requirements and design phase

NOTE: the cost-escalation factor for smaller, non critical software systems to be more like 5:1 than 100:1.

## TWO - Current projects spend 40 to 50% of effort on avoidable rework

Effort spent fixing issues that should have been discovered earlier and fixed less expensively or avoided altogether.

## THREE - 80% of avoidable rework comes from 20% of the defects

That 80% value may be lower for smaller systems and higher for very large ones.

## FOUR - 80% of defects from 20% of modules and 50% are defect free

60 to 90% of defects arise from 20% of the modules, with median 80%, all defects cluster in 50% of modules.

## FIVE - 90% of the downtime comes from, at most, 10% of the defects

Defects disproportionately affect downtime. Analysis of IBM software showed 0.3% of  defects caused 90% of downtime.

## SIX - Peer reviews catch 60% of the defects

Peer review provides an effective technique that catches from 31 to 93% of the defects, with a median of around 60%.

## SEVEN - Perspective-based reviews catch 35% more defects

Improvements in fault detection rates vary from 15 to 50%.

## EIGHT - Disciplined personal practices reduce defect introduction rates by 75%

Best practices are not to punish once the learning curve has been reached they really pay off.

## NINE - Costs 50% more to develop high-dependability software

However, the investment is more than worth it if the project involves significant operations and maintenance costs.

## TEN - 40 to 50% of user programs contain non-trivial defects

Laboratory experiments found defective spreadsheet rates between 35 and 90%.
