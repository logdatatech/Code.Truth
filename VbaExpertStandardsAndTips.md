# S1 - VBA Development Best Practices

Good VBA code should be clean, simple and easy to understand first of all.

The simpler and cleaner it is, the less the chance of bugs slipping in.

As Saint-Exupery coined

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

Moreover, elegant code is usually the result of careful analysis of the problem and finding an algorithm or design,
which simplifies the code greatly (and often speeds it up too).
