# Code Reminders

Setting up Code Reminders we turn the sea of comments into something that is group-able and findable comments to your code that will act as reminders.

SYNTAX is simply a SINGLE UpperCase Word Followed by a ":"

The VS Code Extension [TODO-Highlight]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight supports this very well.

TODO:  
UNDONE:  

To add a reminder/flag/note, type:

an apostrophe \' to start the comment then a space \" \"

the prefix keyword you would like to use KEYWORD then a colon (:)

The following examples demonstrate some reminders you might use.

```vb
' REVIEW: I think this code can be replaced in version 3.0.
' FIX: This is where I made the change to solve the problem in the main algorithm.
' TODO: Establish whether this date is correct.

' UNDONE: I had to change this back until the data conversion is complete.
```

Multi-line Reminders are not ideal keep them on one line the VBA max Line length is more than enough for any one single coherent thought.
